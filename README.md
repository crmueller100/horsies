# Overview
Determining the probability of winning horsies based on each card. 

# What is horsies?
A betting game based on random probability. Each player gets 4 cards (2-Q) that correspond to horses. The goal is to have your horse cross the finish line. There are 11 horses labeled 2-12. Horses move based on that number that comes up when a pair of dice are rolled. Because certain numbers are more likely to come up on dice, the distance each horse has to move is commensurate with the probability of that value coming up on a pair of dice. Here are the distances:
2 horse - 2 slots
3 horse - 3 slots
4 horse - 4 slots
5 horse - 5 slots
6 horse - 6 slots
7 horse - 7 slots
8 horse - 6 slots
9 horse - 5 slots
10 horse - 4 slots
11 horse - 3 slots
12 horse - 2 slots


# Gameplay
Dice are rolled until 4 distinct rolls have occurred. Those 4 numbers indicate "dead" horses and they are removed from the race. After the dead horses are identified and removed from the race, the horses can move. A player will roll the dice until they roll a value of a non-dead horse. If they roll a non-dead horse, that horse moves up 1 slot and the next player rolls. However, if they roll that value of a dead horse, they need to pay into the pot. The first horse to "die" requires a $1 payout. The second horse rquires a $2 payout, etc...If a player is holding 2 cards of the same value of a dead horse, they need to pay double. The game ends when one horse reaches the end. The entire pot is distributed to the players who are holding that card. If Player 1 has 2 cards of the winning horse's value and Player 2 has 1 card, Player 1 gets 2/3 of the pot and Player 2 gets 1/3
